## Inspiration and code snippets

There are so many inspiring blogs and open-source repositories that I cannot
list every one that has helped me over the years. But this is a small selection
of blogs and repositories that have helped me a lot recently.

- Used [Lekoarts' “Minimal Blog”](https://minimal-blog.lekoarts.de/) as a
  template for Gatsby.js. With my switch to Next.js, I ported my version of the
  minimal blog. Over the years I modified it heavily.
- I found a lot of useful code snippets in the code base of
  [Lee Robinson's amazing blog](https://leerob.io/). It helped me move from
  `next-mdx-enhanced` to `next-mdx-remote` and display stats of my Spotify on my
  Dashboard.
- I really liked [François Best's blog](https://francoisbest.com/) and the
  ability to switch the accent color. Very cool feature, thanks!

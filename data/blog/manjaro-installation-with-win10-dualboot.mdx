On my personal machine I like to use Manjaro as my primary operating system, but
sometimes having Windows ready can be very useful. I mainly use it to watch
Netflix, play games, or try out some Windows programs. I will describe in the
following post how I configured my Laptop to dual boot Manjaro and Windows 10
Education.

First, you will need to install Windows 10 in GPT UEFI mode and leave some space
for Manjaro on the hard drive. That can be anywhere upwards from 20 GB. The
average base installation of Manjaro is only about 7 GB. Since, I use it as my
main OS, I installed Windows 10 on 100 GB of my 256 GB SSD and dedicated the
rest to Manjaro.

Next, download [Manjaro][manjaro] and create a bootable USB with [Rufus][rufus].
I chose the Manjaro KDE Edition (17.0.2). Configure Rufus to create a GPT UEFI
bootable USB drive and shutdown your PC. Before you try booting into the Manjaro
Live USB, make sure that your BIOS or UEFI setup is configured to boot from
external media. Also turn off the secure boot. Once you successfully booted
Manjaro from the USB, select to install Manjaro. Follow through the first steps
configuring your keyboard and region. Under **Partitions** pick **Manual
Partitioning**.

Now you should be presented with the following screen:

  height={701}
  width={1108}
  alt="partitions2"
/>

We have to create three partitions, **root**, **home**, and **swap**. First we
create the **root** partition. Select the **Free Space** and hit the **Create**
button.

  width={791}
  alt="root"
/>

The only options we need to specify for all three partitions are **File Size**,
**File System** and **Mount Point**. Specify the size. That should be around 20
GB at least, but can be less. I chose ~50 GB, or, 50470 MB. File system should
be **ext4** and Mount Point **/**. Next, we create the **home** partition:

<Image
  src="/static/img/manjaro-installation-with-win10-dualboot/home.png"
  height={742}
  width={791}
  alt="home"
/>

Here, I specified the size to be 2 GB less than what I have left of my free
space. Those remaining 2 GB I will dedicate to my **swap** partition. File
system should be **ext4** and mount point **/home**. The last partition we
create is **swap**:

<Image
  src="/static/img/manjaro-installation-with-win10-dualboot/swap.png"
  height={742}
  width={791}
  alt="swap"
/>

File size should be those remaining 2 GB and file system is **linuxswap**.
Before we continue, we will have to do one more thing. We have to tell the
system where to install **GRUB**, the Linux bootloader. We will install GRUB on
the same partition as the Windows Bootloader is installed. Generally, that is
partition 2, or **/dev/sdb2**. It is known as the **EFI System Partition**.
Select partition 2 and hit **Edit**. All you need to do is specify the Mount
Point as **/boot/efi**.

  height={632}
  width={478}
  alt="efi"

Now, we can continue. The next screen asks you for user information. Specify
your username, computer name, and password. I applied the following
configuration:

<Image
  src="/static/img/manjaro-installation-with-win10-dualboot/users.png"
  height={701}
  width={1108}
  alt="users"
/>

Click **Next** and you will see a summary of all changes to be made. Double
check that everything is to your liking and then click **Next**.

Once the installation has successfully completed, booting into your new dual
boot system will only allow you to boot into Manjaro at this point. Don't worry,
we will fix that in a second. After Manjaro fully booted, open the terminal and
run the following command:

```bash
sudo update-grub && reboot
```

Now, when you start your computer you should be able to select in the GRUB
bootloader between Manjaro and Windows 10 and your dual boot system should be
fully functional from this point!

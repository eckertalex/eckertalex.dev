I am using **Git** as the version control system for all my projects. Since I
never found a Git-GUI Client that I liked, I am still using git on the command
line. At first, it was quite time-consuming and scary, since I did not know the
tool and its commands well enough. However, as my skills developed, my git setup
started to become more complex. At [eckertalex.dev/git](/uses/git), you can find
a full overview of my current git setup.

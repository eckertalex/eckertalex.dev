With the release of the
[Super Nintendo Classic Edition](https://www.nintendo.de/Diverses/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Super-Nintendo-Entertainment-System/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Super-Nintendo-Entertainment-System-1238330.html)
I decided to revive my **Raspberry Pi 3** running [Retropie][retropie] so that I
can enjoy the SNES games without spending more money. In order to install a
different UI design and scrape game art, I had to connect my RPi3 to the
internet. I started by following [Ryker Dial's
instructions][eduroam_instructions] on how to get my RPi3 connected to eduroam
at UAF. However, somehow it did not work for me and I had to look for another
option.

Since a few weeks, UAF offers an improved version of the UAlaska network. The
process to set up a new connection was improved. With the new version all you
have to do is type in your username and password. After digging around the
internet I decided to give it a try. If it worked, it would also minimize the
work in the future as it is unnecessary to download the needed root and user
certificates.

Here is how to set up a connection with UAlaska on a RPi3. I tested it with
Retropie, but it should also work with Raspbian. Open the terminal (F8 in
Retropie) and type the following:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Now add a new section:

```bash
network={
    ssid="UAlaska"
    scan_ssid=1
    key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    eap=PEAP
    identity="<username>@alaska.edu"
    password="<password>"
    phase1="peaplable=0"
    phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}
```

After this you should be able to select UAlaska as your network and connect to
the internet.

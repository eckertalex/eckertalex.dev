The MIT License is one of the most popular open-source licenses today. If you're
a software developer and haven't taken the time to read the license, you need to
do so now. The chance is high that the libraries you use, use the MIT License.
Notable examples include Ruby on Rails, Node.js, jQuery, and React.

Before we dive into "translating" the MIT License to plain English, let's look
at its history. The MIT License is a permissive free - _free as in freedom_ -
software license that originated at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology
(MIT). According to Gordon Haff, the origin of the MIT License is a mysterious
one, and it's hard to pin its inception to an exact date, but 1987 seems to be
the single best
answer.<sup>[1](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/history-mit-license)</sup>
It is important to note that over the years, it has seen a lot of changes.
However, the Open Source Initiative and Software Package Data eXchange groups
have standardized a generic MIT-style license form as _The MIT
License_.<sup>[2](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html)</sup>

## Reading the original

Now that you have a basic overview, let's begin by reading the original
standardized MIT License from the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT); it is a good idea
to have the whole in mind.

## In Plain English

Here is my attempt at translating it into plain English; if you are more
interested in reading an in-depth analysis, then check out Kyle E. Mitchell's
[The MIT License, Line by Line](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html).

### What I can do

- I can use the software for commercial use.
- I can use the software for private use.
- I can distribute my own copies of the software.
- I can modify the software to my liking.
- I can sublicense the software and/or sell it.

### What I cannot do

- I can NOT hold the author liable for the software.
- I do not have warranty for the software.

### What I must do

- I must include the copyright and license notices in all copies or substantial
  uses of the software.

## Summary

In just one hundred seventy words the MIT License gets a lot of legal work done;
as long as we include the original copyright and license notice, we can do
whatever we want; the MIT License clears a path for open-source software by
granting permission for the software to everyone, for free, while protecting the
authors from liabilities and warranties.

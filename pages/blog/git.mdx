summary: "I started to collect git aliases to simplify version control of my projects."

I am using **Git** as the version control system for all my projects. Since I never found a Git-GUI Client that I liked, I am still using git on the command line. At first it was quite time consuming and scary, since I did not know the tool and its commands well enough. However, as my skills developed, I also started to collect git aliases to simplify some things. At [eckertalex.dev/git](/git) you can find a full list of all my current git aliases.

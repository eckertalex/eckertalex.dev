Yesterday I published a new version of my first VSCode theme - Borealis.

It is a dark theme based on different shades of teal with yellow as its main contrast color. I designed it to be easy on the eyes adhering to the strict guidelines of the [WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

The aurora borealis served as the inspiration for this theme, with it's teal like colors, mixed with violets, pink, greens, and the dark of the night sky in Alaska.

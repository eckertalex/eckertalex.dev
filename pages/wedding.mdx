*Fulda Residence &mdash; Front*

The Residence, which now serves as the town hall and a museum, was built for the prince-abbots by Johann Dientzenhofer between the years 1706 and 1714. This impressive, stately building forms the centre of Fulda’s baroque quarter.

The Historical Rooms in the Residence are well-worth seeing as they provide a good insight into the courtly way of life during the period of Absolutism. Besides the dining hall and the adjoining rooms, you can also see the prince-abbots’ private apartment. There is also a collection of 18th century porcelain from Fulda and Thuringia on display and some elegant rooms which are decorated in the style of the 19th century.

<Heading as="h2" query="residence-garden" className="font-serif">The Residence Garden, the Orangerie and the Flora Vase</Heading>

Near the Residence and the Cathedral in the baroque quarter you find these sights. The Residence Garden, a mixture of the baroque and english garden styles, is Fulda’s ”leafy heart”.

The Orangerie forms the northern border of the Residence Garden. This palace was built by the prince abbots in the 18th century and was used for summer festivities. The Orangerie has elegant baroque rooms and an original sun terrace which make it a wonderful venue for a multitude of events. The Flora Vase, erected in 1728, is directly in front of the Orangerie. It is one of the most beautiful garden sculptures in Germany.

<Heading as="h2" query="cathedral" className="font-serif">The Cathedral</Heading>

*Fulda Cathedral &mdash; Front*

The Cathedral is not just Fulda’s famous, characteristic landmark, it is also the most significant baroque church in the state of Hesse. Following in the tradition of the Roman baroque style, the Cathedral was built by the architect Johann Dientzenhofer between the years 1704 and 1712. Parts of the previous church, the ninth century Rattger Basilka, were integrated in the baroque construction.

The great religious significance of the church derive s from the fact that it contains the tomb of St. Boniface. Still today it is an important place of pilgrimage.

*Wasserkuppe in Winter*

The Wasserkuppe is a mountain within the German state of Hesse. It is a large plateau formation at an elevation of 950 metres (3,120 ft) and is the highest peak in the Rhön Mountains. Great advances in sailplane development took place on the mountain during the interwar period, driven by annual contests. Near the summit there is still an airfield used by gliding clubs and pilots of light aircraft.

Since 1923, the famous flying monument, a bronze eagle on a volcanic basalt chimney, has stood on the western slope of the Wasserkuppe. It commemorates the fallen airmen of the First World War.

The former radar dome (“Radom”) on the summit of the Wasserkuppe is a landmark visible from afar. Formerly a strictly guarded military restricted area, today the area can be visited by everyone. The circuit around the dome is Hesse’s highest observation platform with a unique 360° panoramic view of the land of the Open Distance. The Radom as Hesse’s highest building can also be rented as an extraordinary event location or as a registry office for weddings.

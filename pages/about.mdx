![Me](/static/img/about/me.jpg)

I am a software developer from Germany.
I grew up in a small village on the beautiful countryside of north Bavaria. Here is a picture of my village. It's called Oberweissenbrunn.

As a kid I spent most of my free time running or skiing in the mountains surrounding my village or playing video games with my dad. My dad thought me a lot about computers. We tried fixing hardware problems, like a failing motherboard or a broken ram stick. He showed me how to do a fresh install of Windows XP and more important, he thought me how to troubleshoot problems.

These years of my childhood were probably the most happy I had and the most defining. I see it as the start of my passion for technology and the reason I went to college studying computer science. I started to love technology and solving problems as a kid and continue to do so to this day.

Throughout my life I loved doing sports. I first skied when I was three years old. Nordic skiing was my first choice of sports until my college years. In fact, I would have never studied in Alaska if it had not been for skiing. I was awarded a scholarship for nordic skiing at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks][uaf]. Here is a picture of me at the US Nationals in 2016 for my college team, the [Alaska Nanooks][alaskananooks].

I graduated in Mai 2018 with a Bachelor of Computer Science and landed my first job as a software development intern and later software developer at [AlasConnect][ac]. In college C++ was my main programming language. At Alasconnect I developed full-stack web applications with Haskell and fell in love with functional programming.

In summer 2019, I moved back to Germany and started a new position at [Trive.me - a brand of the EDAG Group][trive_me] as a software developer (frontend). Now I am working with React creating a web applications for our own product and external customers.

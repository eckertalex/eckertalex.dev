title: Git Aliases
slug: "/gitaliases"
---

Most of the aliases that I use come with the oh-my-zsh plugin [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git/).

```bash:title=.gitalias.txt {16,20,25,28,31,34,39,46,50,55,58,61,65}
# ## Usage
#
# Typical usage for a typical user:
#
#   * Save this file as a dot file in your home directory: `~/.gitalias.txt`
#
#   * Edit your git config dot file in your home directory such as  `~/.gitconfig`
#
#   * Include the path to this file.
#
# Example file `~/.gitconfig` with an entry to include the file `~/.gitalias.txt`:
#
#     [include]
#       path = gitalias.txt

[alias]
  ### ALIAS MANAGEMENT ###

  # Show our defined alias list
  aliases = "!git config --get-regexp '^alias\\.' | cut -c 7- | sed 's/ / = /'"

  ### LOOKUP ALIASES ###

  # whois: given a string for an author, try to figure out full name and email:
  whois = "!sh -c 'git log --regexp-ignore-case -1 --pretty=\"format:%an <%ae>\n\" --author=\"$1\"' -"

  # Given any git object, try to show it briefly
  whatis = show --no-patch --pretty='tformat:%h (%s, %ad)' --date=short

  # Show who contributed with summarized changes
  who = shortlog --summary --

  # Show who contributed, in descending order by number of commits
  whorank = shortlog --summary --numbered --no-merges

  ### WORKFLOW ALIASES ###

  # Discard changes in a (list of) file(s) in working tree
  discard = checkout --

  # Clean and discard changes and untracked files in working tree
  cleanout = !git clean -df && git checkout -- .

  # Publish the current branch by pushing it to the remote "origin",
  # and setting the current branch to track the upstream branch.
  publish = !"git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch-name)"

  # Unpublish the current branch by deleting the
  # remote version of the current branch.
  unpublish = !"git push origin :$(git branch-name)"

  ### SHELL SCRIPTING ALIASES ###

  # Get the top level directory name
  top-name = rev-parse --show-toplevel

  # Get the current branch name
  branch-name = rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

  # Get the upstream branch name
  upstream-name = !git for-each-ref --format='%(upstream:short)' $(git symbolic-ref -q HEAD)

  # Execute shell scripts. Git always runs scripts in the top directory.
  # For example "git exec pwd" will always show you the top directory.
  exec = ! exec
```

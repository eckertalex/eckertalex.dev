If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know that finding the time and energy to watch them in one sitting can be a challenge. Each movie clocks in at over three hours. Not to mention, if you're watching with someone who tends to fall asleep during long movies (like my wife), it can detract from the overall experience. In this blog post, we'll explore how to break down the Lord of the Rings movies into episodes, creating a more accessible and engaging experience for all. So grab your elven cloak, and let's embark on an adventure through Middle-earth, one episode at a time.

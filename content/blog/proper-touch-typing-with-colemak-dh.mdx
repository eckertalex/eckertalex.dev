Even though I am typing on a keyboard every day for my work, I am terrible at touch typing. I never put in the effort to properly type on a keyboard. Usually, I try to optimize every workflow. I like the feeling of accomplishment. Efficient processes feel better than inefficient ones, even when the end result is the same—they improve our emotional well-being and quality of life.

## How I learn

I used [Colemak Club](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/) to get accustomed to the layout. Then I would practice with [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/) simple sentences to simulate real words and not gibberish. I tried to prioritize accuracy over speed to not learn bad habits. Accuracy will be hard to learn later. Speed will come naturally.

## Progress

In the first day, my wpm (words per minute) average was just 13. My best 10 words were at a pace of 16 wpm! Not impressive, but acceptable for the first day of practice.

title: 'About Me'
---

I am a software developer from Germany. I grew up in a small village in the
beautiful countryside of north Bavaria. Here is a picture of my village. It's
called Oberweissenbrunn.

As a kid, I spent most of my time running or skiing in the mountains surrounding
my village, or playing video games with my dad. My dad taught me a lot about
computers. We tried fixing hardware problems, like a failing motherboard or a
broken ram stick. He showed me how to do a fresh installation of Windows XP and,
more important, he taught me how to troubleshoot problems.

These years of my childhood were the most happy I had and the most defining. I
see it as the start of my passion for technology and the reason I went to
college studying computer science. I started to love technology and solving
problems as a kid, and continue to do so.

Throughout my life, I loved doing sports. I first skied when I was three years
old. Nordic skiing was my first choice of sports until my college years. In
fact, I would have never studied in Alaska if it had not been for skiing. I was
awarded a scholarship for Nordic skiing at the
[University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://uaf.edu/). Here is a picture of me at
the US Nationals in 2016 for my college team, the
[Alaska Nanooks](https://alaskananooks.com/).

I graduated in Mai 2018 with a Bachelor of Computer Science and landed my first
job as a software development intern and later software developer at
[AlasConnect](https://alasconnect.com/). In college, C++ was my main programming
language. At Alasconnect I developed full-stack web applications with Haskell
and fell in love with functional programming.

In summer 2019, I moved back to Germany and started a new position at
[Trive.me—a brand of the EDAG Group](https://www.trive.me/en/), as a software
developer (frontend). Now I am working with React creating web applications for
our product and external customers.
